- Schedule issues:
    - group changes to improve perf
    - stats widget doesn't get project compute (connected, or not emitted?)
    - ramproject computeestimation use project schedule

- Add an "order" column in all tables and use that instead of storing the order in the data (and separate order changed from data changed signals)
- On close full sync: ignore ramstatushistory to speed up things a bit
- syncing ui better feedback : a status/connected icon + message user@server ( ... )
- project pipeline:
  - RamPipe should contain project uuid
  - update db to add project uuid in pipes
  - use DBTableModel in ramproject to load pipes
- schedule:
  - update db to add project uuid
- RamObjectModel: remove columns; refactor using RamAbstractObjectModel (lookup). Remove RamAbstractItem objectForColumn
- remove server timeout?
- a new RamStatusHistory object, reimplement history (history button in status tables)
- localdatainterface delete data in a single query (see server)
- more tests
- tables: add order column, and update datainterface & dbtablemodel
- DB Auto clean (client & server) Add option to delete removed rows older than 180days by default... 
- can't reorder from status table (disabled?)


4- Ramses and editors
	- asset & shot table
	- improve console colors
	
5A - Settings refactor
	- Add set settings/get settings in RamAbstractObject

		- can be used for everything (including pipes!)
		- remove all other use of settings, except for local app settings
		- save a copy of local app settings to the user settings ? at least some of them (like the appearance). On app quit?

			- open icon: white

7- change messageboxes icons (create a new class with its own static methods)

Hello !

Yep il y a un bug qui traine sur le serveur, mais non ce n'est pas grave ! vérifie juste en bas à droite que tu es pas "offline", et si c'est le cas, pense à te reconnecter.

Normalement ça sera corrigé d'ici demain, l'erreur devrait disparaitre

Bonne soirée,
Duduf
