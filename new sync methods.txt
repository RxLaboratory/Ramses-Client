tables by project

-> fullsync : all tables only if project column is ""

RamApplication
RamFileType
RamProject
RamState
RamTemplateAssetGroup
RamTemplateStep
RamUser

-> projectSync : all tables but with project filter using project column

-> in UI "full sync" = fullsync + current project sync

-> quicksync : doesn't change


/ok/ LOCAL data update methods
/ok/ Server update
/ok/ ldi: setProject
/ok/ ldi: getProject
/ok/ ldi: create with project
/ok/ ldi: project filters on getters
/ok/ Reimplement RamObject to set the project column (creation, update data)
/ok/ on RamObjects storing project, remove project from data and use the column
/ok/ Add project data to sync (server)
/ok/ Add project data to sync (client)
/ok/ Reimplement fullSync
/ok/ Implement projectSync
/ok/ RamServerInterface::downloadData only general tables
/ok/ Server refuses sync in case of wrong app version
/ok/ Pull missing uuids from server
// Full sync should always be synchroneous to be sure everything is better
// Refactor localdatainterface to create a new LocalDataManager class with static methods for queries on a specific db
// RamAbstractObject data integrity checks (a function called on construct, ovrriden by children) calls invalidate() if data is not right.
// Implement Sync by table (for fullSync and projectSync):
   > table one by one, cache incoming data until we've got all tables (both on server side & client side)
   > server::startSyncSession
   > client: send tables one by one
   > server::sync
   > client: when all sent tables are retrieved or if timeout*numTables
   > server::endSyncSession
// Implement pagination, don't send/return more than 100 rows per table
